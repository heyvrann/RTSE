Prospective Users
=================

The intended users are engineers and researchers 
who issue frequent spatial queries on 2D data, such as:

* GIS and mapping services.
* Robotics and autonomous systems.
* scientific computing and simulation.

In all cases, the workflow is the same: insert geometries 
with IDs through a compact C++/Python API, 
then issue window or distance to obtain ID sets that are consumed 
by the host application for visualization, planning, analysis, or statistics.
